# Vue Task Manager App

A simple task management application built using Vue 3 and Vite. The app allows users to organize tasks into three categories: `TODO`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `COMPLETED`. Users can dynamically add tasks, switch their states, and delete tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to the `TODO` list.
- **Switch States**: Click on a task to cycle through states (`TODO → IN PROGRESS → COMPLETED`).
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from any list.

## Demo

The app features a clean and responsive design with three distinct task lists (`TODO`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `COMPLETED`).
